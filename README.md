Guess It
This program has the user choose a difficulty and what ever they pick they then have to guess with in a set range

The console game provies the user with four different difficulty levels and functions as intended. The guessing game contains data validation and ensures the user inputs numbers. I liked how the custom difficulty Own allows you to set your own parameters for the guessing game! Nice job!
